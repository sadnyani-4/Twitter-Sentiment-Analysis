# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets on a given topic. It uses the tensorflow library to build a deep learning model that predicts whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards the topic. The project also uses the numpy and pandas libraries for data manipulation and the matplotlib library for data visualization.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, you'll need to install the following libraries:
- tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Running the code
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the "Machine Learning TA.ipynb" file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells in the notebook.

The code will fetch the tweets related to the given topic, preprocess the text using NLP techniques, and feed the data into a deep learning model built using the tensorflow library. The model will predict whether each tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards the topic. The results will be displayed in a bar chart using the matplotlib library.
